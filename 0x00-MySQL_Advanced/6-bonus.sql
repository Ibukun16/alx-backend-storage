-- A SQL script that creates a stored procedure AddBonus
-- that adds a new correction for a student.
-- Requirements:
-- Procedure AddBonus is taking 3 inputs (in this order):
-- user_id, a users.id value
-- (you can assume user_id is linked to an existing users)
-- project_name, a new or already exists projects -
-- if no projects.name found in the table, create it
-- score, the score value for the correction
